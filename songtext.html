    <h1>Sam Fender - People Watching Lyrics</h1>
    <div>I people-watch on the way back home
    Envious of the glimmer of hope
    Gives me a break from feeling alone
    Gives me a moment out of the ego</div>

    <span>I used to feel so invincible
    I used to feel there was a world worth dreamin' of
    Back in the Gasworks, screamin' the song
    Just the beauty of youth would quell my aching heart</span>
    <span>Oh, I feel so dark rememberin'
    Oh, my heart, I feel so dark rememberin'</span>
    <div>I people-watch on the way back home
    Everybody on the treadmill, runnin'
    Under the billboards, out of the heat
    Somebody's darling's on the street tonight
    Oh, I can't stop runnin'
    I see the whole town fall
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home</div>
    <span>Ooh, ooh</span>
    <div>I came back home after seven years
    Wide awake, tracing tracks of her tears
    Cornered the nurse to get the gist of it
    I promised her I'd get her out of the care home</div>
    <span>The place was fallin' to bits
    Understaffed and overruled by callous hands
    The poor nurse was around the clock
    And the beauty of youth had left my breaking heart</span>
    <div>But it wasn't hard when you love someone
    Oh, I stayed all night 'til you left this life 'cause that's just love</div>
    <div>I people-watch on the way back home
    Everybody on the treadmill, runnin'
    Under the billboards, out of the heat
    Somebody's darling's on the street tonight
    Oh, I can't stop runnin'
    I see the whole town fall
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home</div>
    <span> I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    Above the rain-soaked Garden of Remembrance
    Kittiwakes etched your initials in the sky
    Oh, I fear for this crippled island and the turmoil of the times
    And I'll hold you in my heart 'til the day I die
    Oh</span>
    <div>I people-watch on the way back home
    Everybody on the treadmill, runnin'
    Under the billboards, out of the heat
    Somebody's darling's on the street tonight
    Oh, I can't stop runnin'
    I see the whole town fall
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    I people-watch on the way back home
    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh, ooh</div>
